#### X-Ray

Now letâ€™s head to the AWS X-Ray console and open the *Service Map* menu. We can get the URL for X-Ray Service Map by
running the following command:
```bash
echo "https://${AWS_REGION}.console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home?region=${AWS_REGION}#/service-map"
```


Selecting Trace on the left-hand menu in the AWS X-Ray console, we can view traces the Collector received and exported
to X-Ray for our Create Employee API Call.

Note, X-Ray by default is set to show traces from the Last 5 minutes, if the Employee was created more than 5 minutes ago, increase the window-size (top right).

#### CloudWatch ServiceLens

CloudWatch ServiceLens ties together CloudWatch metrics and logs, as well as traces from AWS X-Ray to give a
complete view of your applications and their dependencies

Let's head to the CloudWatch ServiceLens console. The following command gives a direct link to the CloudWatch ServiceLens console:
```bash
echo "https://${AWS_REGION}.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=${AWS_REGION}#servicelens:service-map/map"
```

The ServiceLens provides us a visualization of both the Container Insight metrics & X-Ray traces gathered by
our OpenTelemetry Collector.
