# Observability with AWS Distro for Open Telemetry

Observability for containerized workloads is essential for business critical environments. In this module, we will
configure an OpenTelemetry (OTEL) collector that gathers metrics and traces. With the OTEL collector configured with the following AWS Services:
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/),
[Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html),
[Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/),
[Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG)](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/).
